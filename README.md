# real-time-speech-translation
This repository contains a real-time speech-to-speech translation system that listens to spoken input, translates it into a target language, and then speaks the translated output. It uses Google Speech Recognition for speech-to-text, MarianMT for machine translation, and gTTS for text-to-speech synthesis.
